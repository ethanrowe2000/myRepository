NOTE: You will HAVE to update the file paths of the text files in this javaFX within the code for it to compile and pull the necessary information
to the program once it runs. This will be located on line 42, 53, and 184.
Other than that, the program should run as expected. I didn't get as much finised as I would like to, so it ends right as you start a fight. But, there
is enough going on behind the scenes to hopefully demonstrate the different things I've learned over the last 8 weeks. I know there is ALOT to 
reduce in this code to make it more efficient and repeat less similar code, but for what it is, it gets the job done.
